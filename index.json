The immense number of BS antennas incurs high system costs, power, and interconnect bandwidth. To circumvent these obstacles, sophisticated MU precoding algorithms that enable the use of 1-bit DACs have been proposed. Many of these precoders feature parameters that are, traditionally, tuned manually to optimize their performance. We propose to use deep-learning tools to automatically tune such 1-bit precoders. Specifically, we optimize the biConvex 1-bit PrecOding (C2PO) algorithm using neural networks. Compared to the original C2PO algorithm, our neural-network optimized (NNO-)C2PO achieves the same error-rate performance at 2x lower complexity. Moreover, by training NNO-C2PO for different channel models, we show that 1-bit precoding can be made robust to vastly changing propagation conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Neural-Network Optimized 1-bit Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oscar Castañeda","Sven Jacobsson","Giuseppe Durisi","Mikael Coldrey","Tom Goldstein","Christoph Studer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1513723313,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513723313,"objectID":"7984cffca1da27c11533d4dfbb949503","permalink":"https://ofcastaneda.github.io/publication/17_jetcas/","publishdate":"2017-12-19T18:41:53-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/17_jetcas/","section":"publication","summary":"Massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) will be a core technology in fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems as it offers significant improvements in spectral efficiency compared to existing multi-antenna technologies. The presence of hundreds of antenna elements at the base station (BS), however, results in excessively high hardware costs and power consumption, and requires high interconnect throughput between the baseband-processing unit and the radio unit. Massive MU-MIMO that uses low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) has the potential to address all these issues. In this paper, we focus on downlink precoding for massive MU-MIMO systems with 1-bit DACs at the BS. The objective is to design precoders that simultaneously mitigate MU interference and quantization artifacts. We propose two nonlinear 1-bit precoding algorithms and corresponding very large-scale integration (VLSI) designs. Our algorithms rely on biconvex relaxation, which enables the design of efficient 1-bit precoding algorithms that achieve superior error-rate performance compared with that of linear precoding algorithms followed by quantization. To showcase the efficacy of our algorithms, we design VLSI architectures that enable efficient 1-bit precoding for massive MU-MIMO systems, in which hundreds of antennas serve tens of user equipments. We present corresponding field-programmable gate array (FPGA) reference implementations to demonstrate that 1-bit precoding enables reliable and high-rate downlink data transmission in practical systems.","tags":[],"title":"1-bit Massive MU-MIMO Precoding in VLSI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oscar Castañeda","Tom Goldstein","Christoph Studer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1508452913,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508452913,"objectID":"a71a7d0b2568e994df0200c1891c8ff3","permalink":"https://ofcastaneda.github.io/publication/17_tcas/","publishdate":"2017-10-19T18:41:53-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/17_tcas/","section":"publication","summary":"Channel estimation errors have a critical impact on the reliability of wireless communication systems. While virtually all existing wireless receivers separate channel estimation from data detection, it is well known that joint channel estimation and data detection (JED) significantly outperforms conventional methods at the cost of high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel JED algorithm and corresponding VLSI designs for large single-input multiple-output (SIMO) wireless systems that use constant-modulus constellations. The proposed algorithm is referred to as PRojection Onto conveX hull (PrOX) and relies on biconvex relaxation (BCR), which enables us to efficiently compute an approximate solution of the maximum-likelihood JED problem. Since BCR solves a biconvex problem via alternating optimization, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for PrOX. We design a scalable, high- throughput VLSI architecture that uses a linear array of process- ing elements to minimize hardware complexity. We develop corresponding field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs, and we demonstrate that PrOX significantly outperforms the only other existing JED design in terms of throughput, hardware-efficiency, and energy-efficiency.","tags":[],"title":"VLSI Designs for Joint Channel Estimation and Data Detection in Large SIMO Wireless Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oscar Castañeda","Tom Goldstein","Christoph Studer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1478212913,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478212913,"objectID":"bad6d5943a00342cc52ab656e61d2c11","permalink":"https://ofcastaneda.github.io/publication/16_tcas/","publishdate":"2016-11-03T18:41:53-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/16_tcas/","section":"publication","summary":"Practical data detectors for future wireless systems with hundreds of antennas at the base station must achieve high throughput and low error rate at low complexity. Since the complexity of maximum-likelihood (ML) data detection is prohibitive for such large wireless systems, approximate methods are necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel data detection algorithm referred to as Triangular Approximate SEmidefinite Relaxation (TASER), which is suitable for two application sce- narios: (i) coherent data detection in large multi-user multiple- input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems and (ii) joint channel estimation and data detection in large single-input multiple-output (SIMO) wireless systems. For both scenarios, we show that TASER achieves near-ML error-rate performance at low complexity by relaxing the associated ML-detection problem into a semidefinite program, which we solve approximately using a preconditioned forward-backward splitting procedure. Since the resulting problem is non-convex, we provide convergence guarantees for our algorithm. To demonstrate the efficacy of TASER in practice, we design a systolic architecture that enables our algorithm to achieve high throughput at low hardware complexity, and we develop reference field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs for various antenna configurations.","tags":[],"title":"Data Detection in Large Multi-Antenna Wireless Systems via Approximate Semidefinite Relaxation","type":"publication"}]
