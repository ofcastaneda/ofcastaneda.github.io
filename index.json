In this paper, we demonstrate that autoencoder (AE)-based CC can be augmented with side information that is obtained during the CSI acquisition process. More specifically, we propose to include pairwise representation constraints into AEs with the goal of improving the quality of the learned channel charts. We show that such representation-constrained AEs recover the global geometry of the learned channel charts, which enables CC to perform approximate positioning without global navigation satellite systems or supervised learning methods that rely on extensive and expensive measurement campaigns.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Channel Charting with Representation-Constrained Autoencoders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexios Balatsoukas-Stimming","Oscar Castañeda","Sven Jacobsson","Giuseppe Durisi","Christoph Studer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562107313,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562107313,"objectID":"f194163b028352ecd7d05487d9c82ac5","permalink":"https://ofcastaneda.github.io/publication/19_spawc/","publishdate":"2019-07-02T18:41:53-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/19_spawc/","section":"publication","summary":"Base station (BS) architectures for massive multi- user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems are equipped with hundreds of antennas to serve tens of users on the same time-frequency channel.
